A tiny `3kb` JavaScript library for prototyping web applications.

Sometimes, all you want to do is to try and do somethingâ€”No boilerplate, bundlers, or complex build processes. Lucia aims to do this, providing an augmentation layer for your logic, allowing you to build just what you need with minimal effort and time.

- **Declarative:** Lucia provides a declarative API similar to Vue to create views, making development predictable and intuitive through markup-centric code.
- **Reactive:** When the view is changed and trapped by the observer, the internal AST will automatically react and will update and render the new view in realtime.
- **Lightweight:** Lucia is extremely light and performant as it renders directives only if necessary by skipping static nodes through element references.

## Getting Started

:::tip
Make sure you have [installed Lucia](/docs/essentials/installation) on to your project.
:::

To pickup Lucia quickly, you should understand how Lucia operates. Lucia requires markup logic to be containerized inside directives, which contain JavaScript expressions with state passed as global variables.

| Directive                                       | Description                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`l-state`](/docs/essentials/components)        | Declares and initializes a new component scope.                                         |
| [`l-text`](/docs/essentials/textInterpolation)  | Works similarly to `l-bind`, but will update the `textContent` of an element.           |
| [`l-html`](/docs/essentials/textInterpolation)  | Works similarly to `l-bind`, but will update the `innerHTML` of an element.             |
| [`l-if`](/docs/essentials/conditionals)         | Toggles `display: none;` on the element depending on expression (true or false).        |
| [`l-on`](/docs/essentials/eventHandling)        | Attaches an event listener to the element. Executes JavaScript expression when emitted. |
| [`l-bind`](/docs/essentials/attributeBinding)   | Sets the value of an attribute to the result of a JavaScript expression.                |
| [`l-for`](/docs/essentials/joiningItems)        | Create new DOM nodes for each item in an array.                                         |
| [`l-model`](/docs/essentials/formInputBindings) | Adds "two-way data binding" to an element. Keeps input element in sync with view data.  |
