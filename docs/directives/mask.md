title: l-mask Directive
---

`l-mask` is removed when an element is rendered. If you want elements to have a certain style on load, this is really useful for you. A typical use case is to use it to hide anything you don't want to show until Lucia renders it.

```css
[l-mask] {
  display: none;
}
```

**Syntax:** `<div l-mask></div>`
